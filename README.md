# HupA
Mathematical model of Vibrio vulnificus heme importer, HupA. The code here can be used to generate Figures 3-10 in "Switch-like behavior in the heme receptor for Vibrio vulnificus" (currently in revision at the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology).

reduced.m can be used to generate all parts of Figure 3.
hupa.ode can be used to generate Figures 4-10.
hupa.m can be used to generate part of Figure 5; hupa.ode can be used to generate the other part.
